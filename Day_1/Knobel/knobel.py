I have captured your friend Python. If you want to have it back, you will have to prove yourself first! I need to find out if you are truly worthy of keeping it.
So, to test you I have created a number of challenges you will need to complete. Whenever you have finished a challenge you can submit your answer to me, the challenger, by running the following python command:

    challenger.submit(key = ___)
    
You need to supply your solution as the key. If your solution is correct you will receive important information about your next challenge. If not, well that's just bad luck. Let's see if you can do this!
